# GameDirectory

This is a Escape Room/Riddle game.
http://sbpolicar.github.io/GameDirectory/

It features Jquery for DOM manipulation, Jquery UI for formatting,
Bootstrap for formatting, and Typed.JS for athstetic reasons.

I did all my HTML and CSS initally, which I think was a bad approach.
Also, I implemented some Jquery plugins much too early which limited my
options for my script.

I have individual click listeners for each riddle button, and they hide and show on each answer click.
It's probably more complicated than it needs to be, which I think was a result of early
implementation of plugins.

Eventually, I want to include the following:
- Audio
- Some sort of intro animation or video
- Input for player names
- a better look.
